== Intro

*SwissKnife* is a multi-purpose library based -only in behavior, not in code- on
other libraries such as https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife[ButterKnife] or
https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations[AndroidAnnotations].

This library is only compatible with http://www.groovy-lang.org[Groovy] language
as it uses its Ast processing to generate the final code.  If you don't use
Groovy on your Android projects yet, you can find some info about how to use it
here.

Don't be afraid of using Groovy,
http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html[Android Studio] supports it
really well, its syntax is almost the same as Java's, it's compatible with
Dalvik and ART and can be mixed with your existing Java code. Also, most times
turning a Java class into a Groovy one is as easy as changing the file extension
from *.java* to *.groovy*.

WARNING: As of Groovy 2.4.0 beta 3, anything compiled using API 21 won't be able to run
fine on < 4.4.4 if you use Bundles -which you probably do-.

=== Annotations

SwissKnife is heavily based on annotations. Most annotations will need only one
parameter named value which can be a View id or a list of ids. When it's the
only annotation parameter, the *"value="* part can be ignored.

[source, groovy]
----
include::{skSampleSrc}/com/dexafree/sample/MainActivity.groovy[tags=injectViewWithId,indent=0]

@InjectView(value=R.id.button)
Button myButton;
 
// To inject several views, the annotation is @InjectViews, in plural
@InjectViews([R.id.view_1, R.id.view_2])
List<View> myViews;
 
// This case here is special. If the name of the field is the same as the id,
// the @InjectView annotation doesn't need any parameters
@InjectView()
Button button_1;
----

Also, you can have several listener injection methods. When the listener is
triggered on the provided view, they will execute the code specified in the
method. On some annotations, a *"method"* parameter is also required to specify
which method of the listener interface will be triggered.

[source, groovy]
----
include::{skSampleSrc}/com/dexafree/sample/MainActivity.groovy[tags=onClick]

include::{skSampleSrc}/com/dexafree/sample/MainActivity.groovy[tags=multipleOnClick]

include::{skSampleSrc}/com/dexafree/sample/MainActivity.groovy[tags=methodAwareAnnotation]
----

=== Injecting Views and Listeners

To make those annotations work, both view injection and listener injection, you
will need to tell your class to use SwissKnife. You can do it like this:

[source, groovy]
----
// Inject an Activity or a View in which "findViewById()" method is accesible
SwissKnife.inject(Object objectInjected);

// If you are using a Fragment or want to inject a View's children into any object, you use this
SwissKnife.inject(Object objectInjected, View viewToInject);
----

For example, in an Activity, you would do it like this:

[source, groovy]
----
SwissKnife.inject(this);
----

And in a Fragment, it would be:

[source, groovy]
----
SwissKnife.inject(this, getView());
----

This means that injection can be used on any class and is done on runtime, so
you can choose when you want that injection to happen.

=== Method declaration:

As stated before, annotated method declarations can't be anything you want, as
this library uses reflection to call them and must have a specified argument
structure. To see compatible declarations with each annotation, please visit
their wiki pages.

Also, as I realized this was difficult to remember, I started working on an
IntelliJ Plugin which creates the annotations, the declarations and imports the
needed classes for you. You can find it <<_intellij_plugin,here>>.
